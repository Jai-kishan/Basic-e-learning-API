# Basic e-learning API
Here I implemented a basic version of an eLearning API, using express framework of Node JS. The users can manage and create different courses exercises and also manage submissions.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
**install express**
```
$ npm install express --save
```
//This is joi, joi allows you to create blueprints or schemas for JavaScript objects (an object that stores information) to ensure validation of key information.
**Install Joi**
```
$ npm i joi
```
